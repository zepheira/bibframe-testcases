Traces of ruling with a sharp tool on some of the leaves (see fol. 116a). The text is fully vocalized. Collation notes and continuous glosses in the margin in black and red ink. Catchword at the end of each quire (quinions). The quires are numbered using Arabic ordinal numerals. From fol. 13 on, the quires are also foliated, using abjad for the leaves and Arabic numerals for the quire (in the form \"b\u0101\u02bc min 6\"). This foliation indicates that some of the quires are incomplete (3d, 6th, 13th ; gap between 6th and 9th) and some leaves misplaced (fol. 42 is part of the third quire). Several inscriptions on fol. 178b. Ownership statement and waqf statement signed \u1e24\u0101jj\u012b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm on fol. 179a (later added flyleaf).

The album consists of what are apparently snapshots taken by members of a touring party, along with photographs by professional photographers, notably W.A. White.", 
        "75 prints feature views of Native Americans and pueblos, including the Hopi and Zuni and identifiable pueblos at Taos, New Mexico and Walpi, Arizona. Some topics include dance, including what is very likely the San Geronimo (St. Jerome) feast at Taos and either the Snake or Flute Dance at Walpi; 69 prints feature views of the surrounding landscapes, modes of travel, or members of the traveling party; 21 prints feature \"typical\" scenes from daily life in and around the areas visited, including scenes of farming, ranching, and cityscapes (of which Albuquerque, New Mexico is known); 13 prints feature mission churches, among which the San Miguel Mission, Church of San Felipe, and Old Parish Church at Taos are identifiable."
