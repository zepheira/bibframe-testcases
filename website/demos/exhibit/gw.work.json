    "summary": "\"The nature of the higher education faculty workforce has radically and fundamentally changed from primarily full-time, tenured or tenure-track faculty to contingent faculty. Regardless of full or part-time appointments, contingent faculty share a common status: short-term contracts, lack of job security, lack of a professional career track, and limited support on campus. We know little about efforts to support contingent faculty beyond broad, relatively uninformative survey data. While a few sources have developed recommendations for supporting contingent faculty, no resources have documented the real changes occurring on campuses and the challenges that occur while implementing new policies and practices. Improving Contingent Faculty Relations presents real cases where these new policies and practices have been implemented, unveiling the mechanisms that are required to create change, the challenges and opportunities that implementers face, and how effective methodology depends upon particular campus contexts. Readers will learn the various pathways to new policies and practices and can align their strategies with proven approaches. Contingent faculty contributors document from first-hand experience the change process on their campuses. Kezar supplements these case studies by distilling trends and patterns from a national study of campuses that have successfully implemented policies to improve conditions for nontenure track faculty. This book is essential reading for both contingent faculty and higher education administrators\"--Provided by publisher.",

    "summary": "Often considered irredeemably conservative, the US working class actually has a rich history of revolt. Rebel Rank and File uncovers the hidden story of insurgency from below against employers and union bureaucrats in the late 1960s and 1970s. From the mid-1960s to 1981, rank-and-file workers in the United States engaged in a level of sustained militancy not seen since the Great Depression and World War II. Millions participated in one of the largest strike waves in US history. There were 5,716 stoppages in 1970 alone, involving more than 3 million workers. Contract rejections, collective insubordination, sabotage, organized slowdowns, and wildcat strikes were the order of the day. Workers targeted much of their activity at union leaders, forming caucuses to fight for more democratic and combative unions that would forcefully resist the mounting offensive from employers that appeared at the end of the postwar economic boom. It was a remarkable era in the history of US class struggle, one rich in lessons for today's labor movement. -- Publisher description.",

With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's version of \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" When the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating. Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up. He describes their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Every chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible questions. When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers watch to find out if he can answer the question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about life and love.",

    "summary": "In many fields, Government outsourcing has created nearly unavoidable potential for improper personal services, contractor performance of inherently governmental functions, or organizational conflicts of interests.  Commingling of government and contractor personnel within the procurement office is not only a bad idea, it also violates the laws and regulations designed to ensure fairness and to protect sovereignty.  Accordingly, the prohibition against personal services must receive renewed emphasis and enforcement.  The ban is firmly grounded in constitutional structure of the nation, its laws, and sound policy judgments.The phenomenon of placing service contractors in Government contracting offices exacerbates the problem.  A vast swath of the federal government's acquisition offices lack the experience and expertise required to manage modern, technologically complex acquisitions.  Agencies have been forced to look outward, to the private sector, to find personnel to perform many procurement functions, \"including requirements-setting and contract management.\"  To avoid running afoul of the Constitution, breaking the law, violating the regulations, or creating irreversibly negative effects on procurements, the Government should ensure that only government employees are assigned to the contracting office.  By staying out of the procurement office, contractors also can avoid cumbersome monitoring and reporting requirements.  The Federal Government must be empowered to fulfill the taxpayer's demands without diluting the democratic principles or sovereignty of the nation.",

    "summary": "Terrorist blacklists constitute an invaluable piece of an effective counterterrorism policy, but like so many legal frameworks that rely on classified information and the word of government officials, they are ripe for abuse. Through a case study this paper examines how one such incident of abuse--the listing of the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a Uighur nationalist group, on the United States' terrorist sanctions list under Executive Order 13224--contributed to the decade long erroneous detention of twenty-two Uighurs in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, and how it could have been prevented with adequate due process protections in place. This incident illustrates that while terrorist sanctions are considered preventive measures rather than criminal punishment, the consequences of listing can be severe and should trigger due process. Due process safeguards are not incompatible with terrorist sanctioning regimes, and incorporating reasonable human rights guarantees will make sanctioning regimes more credible and effective. One existing terrorist blacklist, 8 U.S.C. ?1189, properly balances minimum due process protections with national security interests. This statute--which includes notice, an impartial hearing, presentation of evidence, and the availability of appeal--should be the model of minimum due process required of all blacklisting legislation to eliminate existing loopholes and ensure proper human rights protection in counterterrorism measures.",

    "summary": "Serotonin-containing neurons are the first to develop in the mammalian embryo, and their cell processes eventually project into every region of the brain and spinal cord.  Research on the function of serotonin has revolved around its role as a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system.  Although serotonin is mainly known for its role as a neurotransmitter, it is becoming increasingly apparent that it also has many diverse non-neuronal functions across species, and is present in plants, protozoans, and throughout the metazoans.  Serotonin has also been implicated in the regulation of various morphogenetic events in preneural embryos including cardiac morphogenesis and establishment of left/right symmetry.In this Dissertation research I have utilized the sea urchin, Lytechinus pictus, to examine the role of serotonin in the gastrulation process.  During gastrulation embryo cell rearrangements create the primary germ layers and are necessary for organ formation.  Previous studies in our lab have shown that serotonin levels peak immediately prior to gastrulation in L. pictus embryos and that serotonin is synthesized by a non-neuronal tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme.  Furthermore, serotonin receptor antagonists block gastrulation.  These studies suggest that serotonin initiates the gastrulation process.My research examined the potential role of serotonin as the initiator of the gastrulation process in L. pictus sea urchin embryos.  Previous studies in our lab suggest serotonin must act through a receptor-mediated signaling mechanism in these embryos.  Seven major receptor types and approximately 30 subtypes have been identified in mammals that are collectively linked to many different signaling pathways.  The types of serotonin receptors in the sea urchin genome have not been analyzed, and the receptor types involved in gastrulation are not known.  Furthermore, while serotonin has been chemically detected in the blastula and gastrula embryos, its intraembryonic location is not known.  In the studies described in the three Chapters of this Dissertation research I (1) determined the intraembryonic location of serotonin by confocal immunocytochemistry and examined the role of serotonin synthesis in the gastrulation process by studying the effects of serotonin synthesis inhibition; (2) performed a phylogenetic analysis of sea urchin serotonin receptors; and (3) determined which receptor(s) and signaling mechanism(s) are likely mediating gastrulation from pharmacological analyses and qPCR-generated developmental stage profiles of serotonin receptor transcripts.",

    "summary": "In this dissertation, our objective is to develop the augmented probability simulation as an alternate method to solve particular stochastic programming problems with expectation functions. In the first essay, we propose evolutionary Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to solve one stage stochastic programming problems with constraints and consider certain MCMC methods in constrained domains. We illustrate the implementation of our approach for different settings, including simple deterministic problems with linear/quadratic objective functions, stochastic problems with uncertainty in the objective function or/and the constraint. Overall, the first essay serves as the introduction to the proposed approach, namely, augmented simulation methodology, in solving stochastic problems. In the second essay, we modify our simulation-based approach in order to solve particular two-stage stochastic problems with recourse and demonstrate its implementation using different illustrative examples. A particular setting of a linear production planning problem with uncertainty in constraints is solved by using the proposed algorithm. A version of the same problem with quadratic cost functions is also demonstrated. In the third essay, we adapt our approach to solve the two-stage stochastic recourse problems with decision dependent (endogenous) uncertainty and illustrate the implementation via a production planning problem. In so doing, we consider problems with continuous first stage decision variables under continuous source of uncertainty.  A brief discussion of the potential extension of the proposed method to solve two-stage stochastic dynamic problems is also included. Overall, this dissertation aims to make a contribution to the literature by developing an implementation of this approach for certain two-stage problems with continuous uncertainties. Our limited experience suggests that the proposed approach may provide potential benefits in solving two stage problems and specifically problems with decision dependent uncertainty.",

    "summary": "To increase the profit ratio of trademarks, licensing has become similarly more important for many companies: More and more companies sell services or products under a trademark that they have licensed from another company, relying on the higher likelihood of consumer acceptance, especially if the trademark is already established on the market. The increased number of contractual relationships has, however, also led to a heightened interdependence of the individual companies, especially if one of the parties of a licensing agreement files for bankruptcy and the interests of both parties are brought into a conflict.Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code protects licensees of intellectual property in the event of the licensor's bankruptcy, so that a licensee can choose to continue using the licensed invention. Section 365(n), however, does not provide protection for trademark licenses. This paper argues that given the developments in both bankruptcy and trademark law, the exclusion of trademark licenses from the protecting provision in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code is unwarranted..This paper evaluates the case for extending protection to trademark licensees, and considers the prospects of extending protection to trademark licensees through judicial action, and the ideal shape of legislative reform. It argues that trademark licensees should be granted protection in licensor bankruptcies similar to that enjoyed by licensees of other types of intellectual property.  Further, the \"quality control\" rationale for treating trademarks differently justifies, at most, extending protection to licensees under certain conditions, rather than denying it altogether.  Lastly, the paper argues that trademarks have in recent decades gained more of the qualities of assets or property, and should be treated as such in bankruptcy.In the event of a licensee's bankruptcy, Section 365(c) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the trustee from assigning an executory contract if applicable non-bankruptcy law excuses the non-debtor party \"from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or the debtor in possession.\" Some of the circuit courts have applied the \"hypothetical test,\" which means that if applicable law prevents a debtor from hypothetically assigning the contract to a third party, then Section 365(c) also bars the assumption of the contract. Other courts have adopted the \"actual test.\"  They apply the exception of Section 365(c) only to cases where the trustee actually intends to assign the contract to a third party rather than assuming it for itself.  Courts that adopt this test argue that, although it may be less conform to the literal meaning of the statute, their reading follows the general policy of the Bankruptcy Code.  A third group of courts has created a special exception for debtors in possession, arguing that the language of Section 365(c) only applies to trustees but does not bar assumption from a debtor in possession.A more uniform resolution of the problem that is applicable to trademark licenses as well as to patent and copyright licenses is necessary to give them more certainty about the outcome of a possible bankruptcy. This thesis argues that the test that has been developed in the In re Footstar-decision, which allows the debtor-licensor to retain the license, is more in accordance with the overall policies of the Bankruptcy Code and thus seems appropriate.",

    "summary": "Conventional economic theory assumes that producers supply goods and services in a responsive, reactive way to innate, genuine, unmanipulated consumer demand.  Evidence increasingly suggests, however, that demand is constructed based on the elements present in any given situation, and that the situation is subject to corporate influence.  One method by which corporations construct demand is by using the emotion of disgust to create an apparent problem in an advertisement.  Corporations reference the emotion of disgust not only because it is incredibly powerful, but also because advertisements are able to quickly alleviate the disgusting problem and thereby increase consumer receptivity to the advertised product.  These advertisements exert undue influence over consumers, but more importantly, lead to wasteful consumption that damages the environment in a manner discordant with price.  Consistent with the constitutional requirements of the First Amendment commercial speech doctrine, a ban on these advertisements will prevent the environmental degradation that results from this form of demand augmentation.  While at certain points in history, it may have been ludicrous to be concerned about wasteful consumption, times have changed.  Global climate change will force a restructuring of our economic system to explicitly take into account environmental sustainability and resource conservation by reducing consumption.",

    "summary": "Graphene, a one-dimensional array of carbon atoms, is a unique material which has yet to be fully utilized. It is being investigated for its applications in the digital, analog, and high frequency (RF) domains. While it lacks a natural bandgap, rendering it unsuitable for digital circuitry without additional modification of electrical characteristics, graphene is applicable to a wide spectrum of RF applications ranging from communications platforms to flexible electronics. Specifically, its use in building RF field-effect transistors (FETs) can lead to better performance metrics, higher bandwidths, and faster data transmission rates. Graphene FETs (GFETs) are attractive because the graphene channel can be grown over large-area surfaces, and the devices typically exhibit high electron and hole mobilities and high achievable current densities [1]. In order to bridge the gap between device simulation and circuit design, a closed-form large-signal compact model compatible with commercially available circuit simulators is desired. The primary investigation of this study is to develop such a model and to evaluate its accuracy with measured and simulated data.",

    "summary": "In 2000 rising concern over the destruction of watershed ecosystems prompted \"global governors\" (e.g., inter-governmental organizations, donor agencies, non-governmental organizations, and technical experts) to set a goal of implementing local Integrated Watershed Management (IWM) reforms in all countries by 2015. Many attempts failed due to clashes with local norms and practices, but some succeeded. Why are transnational coalitions of local, national, and international IWM advocates more successful implementing their agenda in some communities than others? What are the processes by which norms and policies developed at the global level change people's behaviors and governance systems at the subnational level? In other words, how do global governors change local governance?This dissertation answers these questions through a subnational comparison of Ecuadorian watersheds. Specifically, it compares attempts to create two new institutions for governing watershed ecosystems: (1) a local, participatory decision-making body, and (2) a local financing mechanism. By creating these institutions local governments and citizens gained the ability to autonomously set policy, raise revenue, and control expenditures for managing local watershed ecosystems. In this sense, they constituted political and fiscal decentralization.Using logistic regression analysis, based on an original dataset of Ecuador's 221 cantons, I find that the presence of transnational environmental networks is the independent variable that best explains why some local governments pursued IWM reforms while others did not. I then compare six case studies to explain why some transnational coalitions were more successful implementing reforms than others. The qualitative analysis draws on 31 months of fieldwork, including more than 200 in-depth interviews. The dissertation presents a process model that explains variation in reform success and identifies key breaking points. Variation in outcome is explained by differences in framing and network construction strategies; different combinations produced either success or breakdown at different stages of the reform process.The findings challenge common assumptions reflected in the \"cascade,\" \"boomerang,\" \"spiral,\" and \"multilevel\" models of global governance. The cases reveal new pathways of influence by which transnational actors implement global policies at the local level in less-developed countries. Local actors in rural Ecuador were poorly connected to the global system and state institutions were weak. Locals were therefore less vulnerable to pressure by international actors and the state than the scholarly literature has suggested. When faced with resistance to watershed management reform, successful coalitions relied on local Ecuadorian advocates who could engage with unwilling subnational groups and play on local vulnerabilities and goals. Rather than pressure from \"above\" or \"below,\" as stipulated in the literature, successful pressure came from \"beside\" as subnational groups engaged in a mutually enforcing circle of pressure. I explain this dynamic in my \"clockmaker\" model of nodal governance.",

    "summary": "Even though environmental regulation can affect the product mix decisions of manufacturers, the environmental economics literature contains almost no research in this area. My research contributes to the limited literature, and fills the gap in the literature for U.S. manufacturers, by providing empirical evidence of the effect of environmental regulation on the product mix of U.S. plants in the pulp, paper, and paperboard industries. Given that many U.S. environmental policies attempt to alter emissions by altering production processes rather than product mixes, the findings in this research are useful for future environmental policies.I first examine the determinants of environmental performance of plants, where environmental performance is measured using two approaches. The first approach is based on chemical inputs and measures environmental performance by the quantity of pollution-intensive and non-pollution-intensive chemicals consumed. The second approach is based on pollution output and measures environmental performance by air pollution emissions. Using the first approach, I find that more productive plants with more water pollution abatement capital expenditures consume less pollution-intensive chemicals. Using the second approach, I find that plants located in counties designated non-attainment for ground-level ozone (O3) have 53 percent lower emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Finally, using the two approaches, I develop a method for classifying products as pollution-intensive and non-pollution-intensive.In the next chapter, I examine the effect of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Pulp and Paper Cluster Rule on product mix. The Cluster Rule combines regulatory requirements from the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, and calls for affected plants to alter their bleaching process away from chlorine-based bleaching agents. In addition to, or in place of, adopting the cleaner technology, plants may choose to comply with the regulation by reducing output of bleached products or dropping some of these products entirely. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, I find that plants facing full Cluster Rule regulation are more likely to drop bleached products relative to unbleached products compared to plants facing only partial Cluster Rule regulation. Furthermore, I find evidence that plants facing only partial Cluster Rule regulation alter their product portfolios toward bleached products.Finally, I use ground-level ozone (O3) county non-attainment status as a proxy for the stringency of environmental regulation to test further how environmental regulation affects product mix decisions. Using fixed effects, I find that plants in O3 non-attainment counties are more likely to drop dirty (VOC-emitting) products, less likely to drop clean (non-VOC-emitting) products, less likely to add dirty products, and more likely to add clean products. Using propensity matching methods, I find that plants in O3 non-attainment counties decrease their quantity shipments of dirty products and increase their quantity shipments of clean products.",

    "summary": "<bold>Self-Cleaning Dilemma; Reconciling Competing Objectives of Procurement Processes</bold>The U.S. and the World Bank's sanctions systems seek to ensure that firms and individuals conduct their work with integrity and that they comply with rules and regulations governing public procurement.  The sanctions systems rely on the use of deterrence, which is most often achieved through debarment or exclusion of non-compliant contractors.  However, in recent years, scholars introduced a self-cleaning theory, which proposes that firms and individuals should be allowed to regain the possibility of participation in public contracts if they have taken effective measures to ensure that wrongful acts will not recur in the future.The proponents of the self-cleaning theory argue that this will improve integrity, that contractors have a fundamental right to public contracts, and that it will increase competition.  The application of the self-cleaning theory to the U.S. and the World Bank sanctions systems illustrates that self-cleaning itself may not improve integrity due to lack of deterrence, that there is no fundamental right to public contracts, but that using self-cleaning instead of debarment increases competition.  Since both integrity and competition are important objectives, there is a need to reconcile the existing tension.The application of the self-cleaning theory to the U.S. and the World Bank sanctions systems demonstrates that it is possible to improve integrity and, at the same time, increase competition.These competing objectives may be achieved through designing a sensible sanctions framework, which takes into account a more flexible approach towards debarment and maintains deterrence, through restitution and other means.",

    "summary": "We exist in a world of \"big data.\" With every cyberspace browsed, e-mail sent, status shared, photo uploaded, tweet tweeted, or search query issued, we leave digital imprints behind, that exponentially increase the massive amount of data floating in the ether, specifically in cables and airwaves. A high volume, velocity, and variety of enormous amounts of data make it challenging to structure, understand, search, data-mine, and visualize them through existing data-mining algorithms. One of the traditional means of understanding this avalanche of data is to classify or cluster large and ambiguous data elements into categories. Data clustering has been the subject of active research in several fields such as statistics, data mining, and machine learning. The amount of research that has been conducted on clustering is approaching a climax, yet the limitations of existing clustering algorithms have largely been ignored.  This dissertation introduces a novel biologically inspired data-clustering model that is based on the natural phenomenon of bird flocking. Bird flocking behavior inspired researchers from different institutions including the United States Department of Defense where it became a sine qua non in most rigorous missions carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this dissertation, we define a multi-disciplinary Swarm Clustering Framework that encapsulates new flocking algorithms which can be used for different clustering settings: batch clustering, stream clustering, or outlier detection. The underlying formula of our approach can be summarized as follows: we model data (e.g. social network online activities, text documents, or gene expressions in microarrays experiments) as flocks of birds flying in a fictional yet observable space where data leaders are being detected, followers flock with their leaders, and over the course of the flocking process the fittest leaders survive to lead its flocks (clusters). We extend the rules that orchestrate flocking behavior in nature to new flocking rules that conform to data clustering: (i) flock homogeneity, and (ii) flock leadership. Large data are thereby represented by flocking birds that can be easily analyzed and visualized. This dissertation follows both a theoretical and practical approach. The theoretical aspect involves a study of the new flocking algorithms in terms of cost analysis, convergence analysis, and proximity measures. In practice, we present (1) the first biologically inspired framework in the literature for identifying communities and community leaders in dynamic social networks inspired from the natural phenomenon of bird flocking, (2) an outlier detection approach to detect outliers cancer samples in gene microarray experiments, (3) a data clustering model entitled \"Flock by leader\" which was applied to information retrieval in text mining and social network analysis. The overall goal is to provide a comprehensive biologically inspired data-mining framework that outperforms the existing data-mining algorithms and which can be applied to solve complex problems in bioinformatics, social network analysis, and text mining.",

    "summary": "A Case Against E-Waste: Where One Country's Trash is Not Another Country's Treasure: Developing National E-Waste Legislation to Regulate E-Waste ExportationOver the past decade, the proliferation of electronic devices in the waste stream has caused an increase in exportation of used electronics to third world countries. As a result of this exportation, several health and environmental issues have manifested. A large percentage of these wastes are shipped to third world countries where the devices are improperly disposed of either through burning or open disposal. The result of such improper disposal is the release of toxic constituents in to the environment. This paper delves in to detail about the toxicity of electronic components, and examines the health and environmental effects of improper disposal of e-waste in third world countries. After discussing the negative implications that improper disposal of e-waste, the paper will examine the current state and local laws that the United States has regarding e-waste disposal, and will discuss the inherent inadequacies. Included in this discussion is an analysis of the success of various state programs and how a proper disposal or recycling scheme should look. The paper then will examine the current national legislation on hazardous wastes, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Then, this paper examines other nations, and their e-waste legislation including the European WEEE and RoHS schemes, and other countries. Finally, this paper lays out a framework for how national legislation within the United States should look, either by amending RCRA or creating entirely new legislation.",

This has triggered speculation that other states will follow suit, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the current international investment system.  This thesis argues that denunciation will not change the current international investment regime because most states' bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\") provide for alternative investor-state arbitration mechanisms.  These non-ICSID alternatives can actually be more disadvantageous to states than ICSID arbitration.  Thus, the denunciation of ICSID is counterproductive.  BITs, rather than ICSID, are the source of the extensive investment protections that form the basis of developing countries' objections to investor-state arbitration.  Therefore, changing the current international investment regime would require the amendment of BITs.",

It undertakes an examination of the relevant regulations, case law, scholarly articles, and approach to realism analysis taken by the international procurement community in order to demonstrate that revisions to the current regulations are long overdue.  The overarching message is that FAR Part 15 needs to be revised to clarify the purpose and process for performing a price realism analysis.  Simple revisions to the FAR, including placing cost realism and price realism analysis in two different sections and explaining how price realism is different than price reasonableness, would clear up a great deal of confusion and would result in fewer sustained protests in this area.  Furthermore, these revisions would provide the government with a valuable tool to ensure that only offerors who can perform for the price proposed are awarded firm-fixed price contracts.  Price realism analysis enables the government to eliminate performance problems associated with offerors that cannot comply with the representations made in their proposals due to underbids.",

An archival data set of 861 male and female adult same-sex twin pairs and their spouses from The Twin/Offspring Study in Sweden (TOSS) was utilized to examine whether adults' recollections of being cared for and protected by their own parents during childhood are related to their current relationships with their own children (Study 1), and account for associations between current marital functioning and the parent-child relationship (Study 2).Results from the first study revealed that the shared environmental influences related to recollections of maternal and paternal care and those related to parent-child closeness were moderately correlated for female twins. For male twins, a similar pattern was found but only for retrospective reports of paternal care. Genetic influences related to male twins' recollections of maternal (but not paternal) care and those related to self-report of parent-child closeness were moderately correlated. The genetic influences related to child reports of closeness with female twins were moderately correlated with the genetic influences related to female twins' retrospective perceptions of maternal care.Study 2 found that retrospective perceptions of parental care explained 13-25% of the covariance between reported marital satisfaction and parent-reports of parent-child closeness, and 55% of the covariance when children reported on their closeness with their parents. In all models, retrospective perceptions of parenting accounted for a significant portion of environmental contributions to covariance between marital satisfaction and parent-child closeness. However, genetic factors explained a significant portion of the remaining covariance between marital satisfaction and parent-child closeness.Overall findings indicate that shared experiences in concert with twins' genetically influenced characteristics account for associations between parents' past and current relationships.

Low income, urban African American youth's disproportionate exposure to adverse life events places them at increased risk of developing adjustment difficulties compared to their middle-class, Caucasian counterparts who generally have less exposure to life event stress (Attar et al., 1994; Deardorff et al., 2003).  However, there is significant variability in youth's responses to life event stress (Leadbeater et al., 1995; McMahon et al., 2003).  Some youth do not display any adjustment difficulties in response to life event stress, while other youth express their distress through internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, or both (Cicchetti&Toth, 1998; Compas et al., 1994; Cooley-Quille et al., 2001; Hankin&Abramson, 2001; Jackson&Warren, 2000).  Consequently, there has been an increased interest in better understanding individual differences in youth's experience of and responses to life event stress.Existing research suggests four possible reasons for variability in African American youth's responses to life event stress: (a) the type of life event experienced (b) the setting in which youth reside, (c) youth's self-perceptions, such as self-worth, and (d) gender differences in the types of life events experienced.  The present study examined specificity of non-violent and violent life events on African American adolescents' depressive and aggressive symptoms and the moderating role of self-worth and gender.

    "summary": "In this dissertation, I test the implications of Campbell and Vuolteenaho's (2004) intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) based on the return decomposition of Campbell (1991).  The return decomposition states that the unexpected market return is composed of cash-flows news and discount-rate news.  The previous literature uses VAR models to implement the return decomposition.  My dissertation adds to the literature by proposing a state-space model approach.  Importantly, the proposed approach has two advantages over the VAR approach.  First, the state-space approach directly and simultaneously models both cash-flow news and discount-rate news by expressing the relation between returns and news in terms of linear regressions, whereas the VAR approach models discount-rate news and backs out cash-flow news as the residual between the unexpected market return and discount-rate news.  Second, the information that I use to extract cash-flow news and discount-rate news is directly related to the market return, whereas the information used in the VAR approach is not.  A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology is developed and used to estimate the state-space model.  Based on the state-space model and the data set used in this dissertation, I am not able to explain the value premium because I do not find that value stocks have higher cash-flow betas than do growth stocks.  The reason is likely that the cash-flow news and discount-rate news estimated in this dissertation are strongly negatively correlated.  With this state-space model, I am now in a position to systematically examine the implications of Campbell and Vuolteenaho's (2004) ICAPM using other data sets and other time periods in future studies.",

    "summary": "The first chapter fills a gap in the literature by examining the variation through time in the credit spread on high-yield bonds.  I use methods common in the equity market literature to identify the portion of the credit spread attributable to the expected excess return on high-yield bonds and label it the \"credit risk premium.\"  I demonstrate that the credit risk premium predicts excess returns on high-yield bonds and its variation can be explained by classical measures of economic risk.The  second chapter asks \"what do we really know about the rise in U.S. residential mortgage defaults?\"  My answer: not as much as we may think.  I use loan category data from the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) to test and reject the hypothesis that the rise in default volumes and subsequent failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was caused by an increase in the share of \"subprime\" mortgages.   I also demonstrate that the product-specific features of Alt-A and interest-only mortgages are unlikely to be an exogenous source of variation in default performance because these mortgages were concentrated in \"hot\" housing markets that experienced the largest price increases and subsequent declines.In the third chapter,  I develop a theory of an endogenous convenience yield to homeownership.  An owner-occupier derives a flow of services unavailable to the renter of an otherwise identical residence.  Among these are the ability to enter into a long-run housing contract, the ability to customize the residence to the precise tastes of the owner-occupier, the non-pecuniary benefits associated with homeownership (child development, stability, social status, etc.), and the ability to pledge the house as collateral for external finance to smooth lifetime non-housing consumption.  The logic of an endogenous convenience yield is that house price variation unrelated to changes in equivalent rental value can be explained by changes in the value of these services.",

    "summary": "Tracking maneuvering targets is an important but difficult problem. This problem occurs when tracking maneuvering boats or even people wandering around. If the target motion is linear and the measurement errors are Gaussian, then a Kalman filter provides the optimal estimates. However, since maneuvering targets do not generally exhibit linear motion, a Kalman filter will often produce poor estimates for these targets. A better approach would be to exploit the kinematic constraints of the target motion to restrict the predicted states to those where the target could have transitioned. But exploiting these constraints will produce bounded, non-Gaussian prediction distributions. A Kalman filter must assume that this prediction distribution is Gaussian. Grid-based filters (GBFs) can work with any prediction distribution so they allow the kinematic constraints to be exploited. As a result, GBFs should be very effective at producing accurate state estimates. But current implementations of GBFs typically require large memories and exponential processing. As a result, although grid-based filters should be effective, they have been avoided due to their perceived exponential computational complexity. A novel approach for implementing a GBF, called a constrained grid-based filter (CGBF), has been developed that can track targets moving in two dimensions by using a well-confined, two-dimensional grid. This paper will expose the problems with current GBFs and then explain how they are avoided in a CGBF. As a result, this grid-based approach is enormously more computationally efficient and can effectively exploit the kinematic constraints of the target. The paper will discuss how the kinematic constraints of the target are used to restrict the possible predicted states, including the formalism to show how the predicted state from the CGBF is better bounded than from a Kalman filter.In systems engineering, when two or more alternative solutions exist, it is important to conduct an analysis of alternatives (AoA) to determine the best systems approach. An AoA will be conducted to compare the tracking performance of a CGBF to a Kalman filter for maneuvering target scenarios. The target state estimates (position and velocity) will be analyzed via Monte Carlo analysis. This study will employ two comparison methods including the comparison paradigm presented by Kirubarajan and Bar-Shalom. The intent of this study is to determine how maneuverable the target must be to gain the benefit from a CGBF over a Kalman filter. Keep in mind that when all Kalman filter assumptions hold, it is the optimal filter. This paper will discuss the target motion model, the CGBF implementation, and the Kalman filter used for the study. The results will show that by restricting the prediction distribution based on the presumed (realistic) kinematic constraints of the target, a more informed filter will result. Thus, by violating the one key Kalman filter assumption, it will be shown that the CGBF consistently outperforms a Kalman filter, even for the linear motion target case. Furthermore, the improvement from the CGBF increases relative to a Kalman filter as the target becomes more maneuverable.Although the CGBF is much less computational than current GBF methods, it is still more computational than a Kalman filter. The paper will discuss the grid and sample sizing needed to obtain quality estimates from a CGBF. It will be shown that the sizes are much smaller than what may be expected and that the CGBF is quite stable even when using these small sizes.",

    "summary": "The objective of this thesis is to analyze the WTO rules that regulate the use of scientific evidence by determining whether they adequately protect due process and thereby ensuring fair trials.  One decision of the WTO Appellate Body, for example, has protected millions of people from the exposure of asbestos-related products.   On the other hand, the WTO dispute resolution process has enabled the distribution of consumable products that may harm human health.   These WTO decisions relied on scientific opinions to justify their conclusions.  Given the pervasive impact of WTO decisions, their accuracy and certainty cannot be compromised.The general rules and procedures governing the resolution of trade disputes are provided in the WTO's Understanding of Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), which is administered by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB).   Since 1995, the DSB has been applying the DSU in evaluating the admissibility and use of scientific evidence.  Given the increase in the reliance on science in trade disputes, there is a need for new rules and procedures in the admission and usage of scientific evidence.  This thesis argues that the current DSU provisions are archaic and inadequate in addressing the vulnerabilities in applying forensic science.  As a result, the WTO cannot guarantee disputing parties the right to a fair trial.",

    "summary": "The health of the Chesapeake Bay has been a national concern for over twenty-five years, but no single policy approach has successfully restored the impaired water quality of the Bay. Nutrient trading is a market-based approach that is intended to achieve reductions in nutrient pollution and improve water quality using the most cost-effective means. Trading is an appealing option for the Chesapeake Bay because a major group of nutrient pollution contributors, agricultural non-point sources, may institute relatively inexpensive conservation practices to achieve nutrient reductions and produce tradable credits. While it is true that previous attempts to facilitate trading have been more successful in theory than in practice, trading offers several popular features that make it a more acceptable option to address nutrient pollutions than other policy alternatives. As such, trading can be a valuable tool when used in conjunction with other reduction mechanisms. Particularly in a political climate where alternative regulatory approaches are likely to be seriously encumbered, nutrient trading can advance nutrient reduction efforts and complement, or even temporarily supplement, other policy options. Despite the limitations of trading, it may be the most feasible approach in the near term considering that new, comprehensive command and control regulations of non-point sources and other mechanisms like nutrient taxes are not likely to be politically feasible for some time. To improve the chances of success for nutrient trading in the Bay, existing state trading programs must be harmonized, and trading participation must improve. Engaging interested participants, particularly agricultural non-point sources of nutrient pollution, and developing better program infrastructure now will help ensure program integration and increase the likelihood of a successful Bay-wide trading scheme in the future.",

    "summary": "Moment Curvature Analysis Program (MCAP) has been developed for establishing moment-curvature analyses using an interface between a MATLAB? Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the finite element program Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees).  The MATLAB? GUI was developed with the main goal of facilitating the use and interpretation of OpenSees. The combination of these two software programs provides a user friendly interface that can be used to supplement classroom instruction and enhance learning the response of sections using accurate nonlinear material stress-strain relationships.MCAP was primarily developed within a framework that guides the user through a logical sequence of steps for determining the moment and rotation capacity of commonly used structural sections.  The simplicity of its use and its framework makes it particularly suitable as a teaching aid for graduates and undergraduates to analyze irregular and commonly used structural sections. Moment-curvature relationships are of primary importance in evaluating the nonlinear behavior of sections, members and structural systems.Some features of MCAP can be summarized as follows: (1) MCAP has been extended to analyze rectangular, circular and user defined arbitrary shape sections. (2) The development of a GUI interface for a user defined arbitrary shape section is significant as a teaching aid since most Moment-Curvature programs do not allow the user to define and analyze sections other than rectangular and circular sections.  (3) MCAP also has the capability to perform a Moment-Curvature analysis on a rotated rectangular section.To further enhance classroom instruction a supplementary moment-curvature program was also implemented using MATLAB?. In its present form, this supplementary program can be used by users in tracing the programming steps required to develop a moment curvature analysis and subsequent load deformation response of rectangular reinforced concrete sections.  One of the innovative features in the programming of this supplementary program is the implementation of a linear relationship between the curvature and the strains in the extreme steel fibers.  To the best knowledge of the author, this linear relationship has not been previously used in encoding the moment curvature program.  The main implication of this relationship is a significant decrease in the number of iterations required for convergence.Future developments for MCAP include a pile analysis module and expanding the program to perform a pushover analyses for reinforced concrete members. The implementation of a FRP confined section module is also being developed with an immediate application to the retrofit of circular and rectangular concrete sections.  Further research on the relationship between the curvature and the strains in the extreme steel fibers is a future development that MCAP can help accomplish.",
