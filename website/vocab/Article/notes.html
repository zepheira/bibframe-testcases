    <p>Refinements of CreativeWorks are derived from a combination of LoC 'Classes and captions for resource types (11/28/11)' and subclasses of Schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a>.</p>

    <p>Refinement relationships (author, illustrator, sculptor, etc.) are defined as subproperties of this property. As a start, I suggest we focus on a subset of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">MARC relator terms</a> what might be applicable to Works. Cardinatlity and manadatory constraints are overlayed as a community defined profile of this model. </p>
