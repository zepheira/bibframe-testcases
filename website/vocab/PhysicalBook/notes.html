    <p>Refinement relationships (producer, publisher, distributor, manufacturer, etc.) are defined as subproperties of this property. As a start, I suggest we focus on a subset of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">MARC relator terms</a> what might be applicable to Instances. If we decide there is the need for more than a single entitiy associated with an Instance (an instance has more than one publisher / publishedAt / publishedOn combination of assertions) we'll need to materilize this pattern.</p>
