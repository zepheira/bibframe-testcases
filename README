''The Library of Congress has asked Zepheira to provide a model (or models) that can serve as a strong starting point for discussion, and an analysis of related initiatives underway that will be useful to this effort.  LC expects that the proposed model(s) will change and be further tuned based on valuable feedback from the community and a natural progression of requirements as they are addressed. The initial model(s) will serve as a basis for work focused on a demonstration system/service which will then, in turn, be used to further refine the model(s). The expectation is that such iterative feedback loops will eventually ensure a flexible bibliographic framework, a robust reference code, a supporting infrastructure for deployment, and an effective migration plan to support the community in making a transition from MARC to a new framework.''

----

This follows from late 2011 when LC decided to make a transition from MARC to a more modern bibliographic framework.

viz. [[http://www.loc.gov/marc/transition/news/framework-103111.html|A Bibliographic Framework for the Digital Age (October 31, 2011)]]

Some key quotes:

''“Recognizing that Z39.2/MARC are no longer fit for the purpose, work with the library and other interested communities to specify and implement a carrier for bibliographic information that is capable of representing the full range of data of interest to libraries, and of facilitating the exchange of such data both within the library community and with related communities.”''

''Several of the test organizations [considering Resource Description and Access (RDA)] were especially concerned that the MARC structure would hinder the separation of elements and ability to use URLs in a linked data environment.''

== Requirements for a New Bibliographic Framework Environment ==

''Bibliographic framework is intended to indicate an environment rather than a "format".''

 * ''Broad accommodation of content rules and data models.
Provision for types of data that logically accompany or support bibliographic description, such as holdings, authority, classification, preservation, technical, rights, and archival metadata.''
 * ''Accommodation of textual data, linked data with URIs instead of text, and both. It is recognized that a variety of environments and systems will exist with different capabilities for communicating and receiving and using textual data and links.''
 * ''Consideration of the relationships between and recommendations for communications format tagging, record input conventions, and system storage/manipulation.''
 * ''Consideration of the needs of all sizes and types of libraries, from small public to large research.''
 * ''Continuation of maintenance of MARC until no longer necessary.''
 * ''Compatibility with MARC-based records.''
 * ''Provision of transformation from MARC 21 to a new bibliographic environment.''


== Developing XML formats for bibliographic and related data. ==

''...an alternative format structure for MARC 21 was established in recent years: MARCXML, which is simply a transformation of the ISO 2709 structure of MARC 21 to an XML structure leaving the MARC 21 tagging and coding of data intact.''

''Another initiative has been the development of MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) and MADS (Metadata Authority Description Schema), which are XML schema that are highly compatible with MARC bibliographic and authority data but have somewhat simpler word-based tagging.  They also address some of the organizational, extensibility, and linking needs of bibliographic data today.  This effort has dealt with the limitations of MARC tagging and organization of data, while retaining much of its ability to carry rich bibliographic data that is used in our current technical environment. Partially in response to library administrator pressure for decades, MODS intentionally avoids the detailed tagging and redundancies found in MARC.''

''Both MARCXML and MODS were developed partly to enable MARC-related bibliographic data to be in synch with communication protocols such as SRU (Search and Retrieve via URL) and OAI (Open Archive Initiative) and formats like METS (Metadata Encoding and Transfer Standard) that prefer or require XML data records.  These have given the community experience with using a different structure.  MADS in RDF (Resource Description Framework) is another area where development is enabling experimentation with a different structure.''

''LC has also maintained transformations for the MARCXML, MODS, MADS, and Dublin Core data formats and shared them with the community, yielding valuable experience in the ease and difficulty of transformation of data between formats that may have different granularity in tagging.''

'''''Accommodating RDA'''. The Network Development and MARC Standards Office (NDMSO) at LC has worked with the community to integrate RDA data in the MARC 21 format. This still ongoing effort has enabled the MARC format to better accommodate data formulated according to RDA instructions. Mappings between RDA and MARC and RDA and MODS are published in the RDA Toolkit.''

'''''Making LC vocabularies available as Linked Data.''' LC has developed and implemented a web service for stable and trusted vocabularies which has contributed to experimentation with linked data in the community (id.loc.gov).  As part of this initiative, a data model for MADS as RDF was developed that enables this linked data service to expose the rich MARC data in an RDF form.  RDF is currently the preferred linked data publishing model.''

'''''Increased interest in and experimentation with RDF-based models.''' While still in a developmental and experimental stage, the theories and technologies of the Linked Data initiative being explored by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) may provide the potential to widely share our rich bibliographic and related data with communities both within and outside of the library environment.  Over the last year an international group sponsored by the W3C studied the potential for library data in the Linked Data space.  The conclusion was positive, and a great deal of thought went in to identifying possible use cases and recommendations.''
