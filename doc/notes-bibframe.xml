  <annotation on='CreativeWork.mainEntry'> 
    <p>In the development of MODS LC found that in some contexts it's essential to separate a main item associated with the creative work.  In MODS this became the principal or primary name.  Note the conflation of person &amp; family here. RDA makes that distinction.</p>

  <annotation on='CreativeWork.addedEntry'> 
    <p>In MODS this became just a name, but not the principal or primary name.</p>
  </annotation> 

  <annotation on='CreativeWork.relatedTo'> 
    <p>Can use <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/">MARC relators</a> or FRBR-defined relationships to clarify the nature of the relationships</p>
  </annotation> 

  <annotation on='Instance.publisher'> 
    <p>We might have to consider publication statement, which is basically focus on the event associated with publication, rather than the entity. So this could be called "publication".</p>
